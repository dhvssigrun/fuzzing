# Grammar based fuzzing

These assume you have set up the directory structure as explained in tutorial-sample-project.md

## Dharma

Pull Dharma in ffw:

```
    git clone https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/dharma.git
```

Open fuzzing.py and change the fuzzer variable:

```
    "fuzzer": "Dharma"
```

Add your grammars to the grammars file in the project. For example from the ffw root folder:

```
    cp dharma/dharma/grammars/grammar.dg vulnserver/grammars
```

You can specify a different grammars file in fuzzing.py

Do not run the interceptor. Your testcases will be generated by the grammar fuzzer using the grammar you provided.

To run the fuzzer:
```
    cd vulnserver
    ./fuzzing.py --fuzz --debug
```
