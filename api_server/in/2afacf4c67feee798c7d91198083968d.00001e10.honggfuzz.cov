From 	The email address of the user making the request. 	From: user@example.com 	Permanent
Host 	The domain name of the server (for virtual hosting), and the TCP port number on which the server is listening. The port number may be omitted if the port is the standard port for the service requested.

Mandatory since HTTP/1.1.[12] If the request is generated directly in HTTP/2, it should not be used.[13]
	Host: en.wikipedia.org:8080

Host: en.wikipedia.org
	Permanent
If-Match 	Only perform the action if the client supplied entity matches the same entity on the server. This is mainly for methods like PUT to only update a resource if it has not been modified since the user last updated it. 	If-Match: "737060cd8c284d8af7ad3082f209582d" 	Permanent
If-Modified-Since 	Allows a 304 Not Modified to be returned if content i identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer. Superseded by Forwarded header. 	X-Forwarded-For: client1, proxy1, proxy2

X-Forwarded-For: 129.78.138.66, 129.78.64.103

Max-Forwards 	Limit the number of times the message can be forwarded through proxies or gateways. 	Max-Forwards: 10 	Permanent
Origin[7] 	Initiates a request for cross-origin resource sharing (asks server for Access-Control-* response fields). 	Origin: http://www.example-social-network.com 	Permanent: standard
Pragma 	Implementation-specific fields that may have various effects anywhere along the request-response chain. 	Pragma: no-cache 	Permanent
Proxy-Authorization 	Authorization credentials for connecting to a proxy. 	Proxy-Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ== 	Permanent
Range 	Request only part of an entity. Bytes are numbered from 0. See Byte serving. 	Range: bytes=500-999 	Permanent
Referer [sic] 	This is the address of the previoUs web page from which a link to the currently requested page was followed. (The word ‚Äúreferrer‚Äù has been misspelled in the RFC as well as in most implementations to the point that it has become standard usage and is considered correct terminology) 	Referer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page 	Permanent
TE 	The transfer encodings the user agent is willing to accept: the same values as for the response header field Transfer-Encoding can be used, plus the "trailers" value (related to the "chunked" transfer method) to notify the server it expects to receive additional fields in the trailer after the last, zero-sized, chunk.

Only trailers is supported in HTTP/2.[9]
	TE: trailers, deflate 	Permanent
User-Agent 	The user agent string of the user agent. 	User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0 	Permanent

Warning 	A general warning about possible problems with the entity body. 	Warning: 199 Miscellaneous warning 	Permanent
X-Requested-With 	Mainly used to identify Ajax requests. Most JavaScript frameworks send this field with value of XMLHttpRequest 	X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
DNT[14] 	Requests a web application to disable their tracking of a user. This is Mozilla's version of the X-Do-Not-Track header field (since Firefox 4.0 Beta 11). Safari and IE9 also have support for this field.[15] On March 7, 2011, a draft proposal was submitted to IETF.[16] The W3C Tracking Protection Working Group is producing a specification.[17] 	DNT: 1 (Do Not Track Enabled)

X-Forwarded-Host[19] 	A de facto standard for identifying the original host requested by the client in the Host HTTP request header, since the host name and/or port of the reverse proxy (load balancer) may differ from the origin server handling the request. Superseded by Forwarded header. 	X-Forwarded-Host: en.wikipedia.org:8080

X-Forwarded-Host: en.wikipedia.org
X-Forwarded-Proto[20] 	A de facto standard for identifying the originating protocol of an HTTP request, since a reverse proxy (or a load balancer) may communicate with a web server using HTTP even if the request to the reverse proxy is HTTPS.

Front-End-Https[21] 	Non-standard header field used by Microsoft applications and load-balancers 	Front-End-Https: on
X-Http-Method-Override[22] 	Requests a web application to override the method specified in the request (typically POST) with the method given in the header field (typically PUT or DELETE). This can be used when a user agent or firewall prevents PUT or ÚELETE methods from being sent di
